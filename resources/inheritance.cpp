class Person

  ... .. ...

class MathsTeacher : public Person
{

};

class Footballer : public Person
{
  .... .. ...
};

The derived class appears with
	- the declaration of a class followed by a colon
	- the keyword public and the name of base class from which it is derived.

Since, MathsTeacher and Footballer are derived from Person,
all data member and member function of Person can be accessible from them.

When creating a derived class from a base class, you can use different access specifiers to inherit the data members of the base class.

These can be public, protected or private.

In the above example, the base class Person has been inherited public-ly by MathsTeacher and Footballer.

Also, the member function of derived class overrides the member function of base class.
